	abstract = {Skin sensitisation is an important toxicological endpoint. The possibility that chemicals used in the workplace and in consumer products might cause skin sensitisation is a major concern for individuals, for employers and for marketing. In European REACH (Registration, Evaluation, and Authorisation of Chemicals) legislation, the sensitising potential should therefore be assessed for chemicals below the 10 ton threshold. Development of methods for prediction of skin sensitisation potential without animal testing has been an active research area for some time, but has received further impetus with the advent of REACH and the EU Cosmetics Directive (EU 2003). This paper addresses the issue of non-animal based prediction of sensitisation by a mechanistic approach. It is known that the sequence of molecular, biomolecular and cellular events between exposure to a skin sensitiser and development of the sensitised state involves several stages, in particular penetration through the stratum corneum, covalent binding to carrier protein, migration of Langerhans cells, presentation of the antigen to naïve T-cells. In this paper each of these stages is considered with respect to the extent to which it is dependent on the chemical properties of the sensitiser. The evidence suggests that, although penetration of the stratum corneum, stimulation of migration and maturation of Langerhans cells, and antigen recognition are important events in the induction of sensitisation, except in certain specific circumstances they can be taken for granted. They are not important factors in determining whether a compound will be a sensitiser or not, nor are they important factors in determining how potent one sensitiser will be relative to another. The ability to bind covalently to carrier protein is the major structure-dependent determinant of skin sensitisation potential. A chemistry-based prediction strategy is proposed involving reaction mechanistic domain assignment, reactivity and hydrophobicity determination, and application of quantitative mechanistic modelling (QMM) or read-across.},

	abstract = {Predictive testing to characterize substances for their skin sensitization potential has historically been based on animal tests such as the Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA). In recent years, regulations in the cosmetics and chemicals sectors have provided strong impetus to develop non-animal alternatives. Three test methods have undergone OECD validation: the direct peptide reactivity assay (DPRA), the KeratinoSens™ and the human Cell Line Activation Test (h-CLAT). Whilst these methods perform relatively well in predicting LLNA results, a concern raised is their ability to predict chemicals that need activation to be sensitizing (pre- or pro-haptens). This current study reviewed an EURL ECVAM dataset of 127 substances for which information was available in the LLNA and three non-animal test methods. Twenty eight of the sensitizers needed to be activated, with the majority being pre-haptens. These were correctly identified by 1 or more of the test methods. Six substances were categorized exclusively as pro-haptens, but were correctly identified by at least one of the cell-based assays. The analysis here showed that skin metabolism was not likely to be a major consideration for assessing sensitization potential and that sensitizers requiring activation could be identified correctly using one or more of the current non-animal methods.},

Although several in silico alternatives are available and achievements have been made in the development and regulatory adoption of skin sensitisation non-animal tests, there is not yet a generally accepted approach for skin sensitisation assessment that would fully substitute the need for animal testing. The aim of this work was to build a defined approach (i.e. a predictive model based on readouts from various information sources that uses a fixed procedure for generating a prediction) for skin sensitisation hazard prediction (sensitiser/non-sensitiser) using Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) results as reference classifications. To derive the model, we built a dataset with high quality data from in chemico (DPRA) and in vitro (KeratinoSens™ and h-CLAT) methods, and it was complemented with predictions from several software packages. The modelling exercise showed that skin sensitisation hazard was better predicted by classification trees based on in silico predictions. The defined approach consists of a consensus of two classification trees that are based on descriptors that account for protein reactivity and structural features. The model showed an accuracy of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.98, and specificity of 0.85 for 269 chemicals. In addition, the defined approach provides a measure of confidence associated to the prediction.},

	abstract = {Molecular graph serves as a convenient model for any real or abstract chemical compound. A topological index is the graph invariant number calculated from the graph representing the molecule. The advantage of topological indices is that it may be used directly as simple numerical descriptors in QSPR/QSAR models. Most of the topological descriptors are based either on atom-atom connectivity or on topological distances. A chemical reaction can be represented as the transformation of the chemical (Molecular) graph representing the reaction’s substrate into another chemical graph representing the product. The type of chemical reaction where two substrates combine to form a single product (combination reaction) motivated us to study the effect of topological indices when a bridge is introduced between the respective vertices (of degree i, i=1, 2, 3) of two copies of the same graph. The graph obtained in this manner may or may not exist in reality, but it is the interest of the chemist to check the stability of the so obtained structure of the product. In this paper we present an algorithm to calculate the distance matrix of the resultant graph obtained after each iteration and thereby tabulate various topological indices. We also give the explicit formula for calculating Wiener index of the graph representing the resulting product.},

Using Bayesian optimization methods to tune the network architecture, we show that an optimized SMILES2vec model can serve as a general-purpose neural network for predicting distinct chemical properties including toxicity, activity, solubility and solvation energy, while also outperforming contemporary MLP neural networks that uses engineered features. Furthermore, we demonstrate proof-of-concept of interpretability by developing an explanation mask that localizes on the most important characters used in making a prediction. When tested on the solubility dataset, it identified specific parts of a chemical that is consistent with established first-principles knowledge with an accuracy of 88\%. Our work demonstrates that neural networks can learn technically accurate chemical concept and provide state-of-the-art accuracy, making interpretable deep neural networks a useful tool of relevance to the chemical industry.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new representation and feature extraction method for biological sequences. Named bio-vectors (BioVec) to refer to biological sequences in general with protein-vectors (ProtVec) for proteins (amino-acid sequences) and gene-vectors (GeneVec) for gene sequences, this representation can be widely used in applications of deep learning in proteomics and genomics. In the present paper, we focus on protein-vectors that can be utilized in a wide array of bioinformatics investigations such as family classification, protein visualization, structure prediction, disordered protein identification, and protein-protein interaction prediction. In this method, we adopt artificial neural network approaches and represent a protein sequence with a single dense n-dimensional vector. To evaluate this method, we apply it in classification of 324,018 protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot belonging to 7,027 protein families, where an average family classification accuracy of 93\%±0.06\% is obtained, outperforming existing family classification methods. In addition, we use ProtVec representation to predict disordered proteins from structured proteins. Two databases of disordered sequences are used: the DisProt database as well as a database featuring the disordered regions of nucleoporins rich with phenylalanine-glycine repeats (FG-Nups). Using support vector machine classifiers, FG-Nup sequences are distinguished from structured protein sequences found in Protein Data Bank (PDB) with a 99.8\% accuracy, and unstructured DisProt sequences are differentiated from structured DisProt sequences with 100.0\% accuracy. These results indicate that by only providing sequence data for various proteins into this model, accurate information about protein structure can be determined. Importantly, this model needs to be trained only once and can then be applied to extract a comprehensive set of information regarding proteins of interest. Moreover, this representation can be considered as pre-training for various applications of deep learning in bioinformatics.

	abstract = {Drug discovery is an academical and commercial process of global importance. Accurate identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) can significantly facilitate the drug discovery process. Compared to the costly, labor-intensive and time-consuming experimental methods, machine learning (ML) plays an ever-increasingly important role in effective, efficient and high-throughput identification of DTIs. However, upstream feature extraction methods require tremendous human resources and expert insights, which limits the application of ML approaches. Inspired by the unsupervised representation learning methods like Word2vec, we here proposed SPVec, a novel way to automatically represent raw data such as SMILES strings and protein sequences into continuous, information-rich and lower-dimensional vectors, so as to avoid the sparseness and bit collisions from the cumbersomely manually extracted features. Visualization of SPVec nicely illustrated that the similar compounds or proteins occupy similar vector space, which indicated that SPVec not only encodes compound substructures or protein sequences efficiently, but also implicitly reveals some important biophysical and biochemical patterns. Compared with manually-designed features like MACCS fingerprints and amino acid composition (AAC), SPVec showed better performance with several state-of-art machine learning classifiers such as Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Random Forest and Deep Neural Network on BindingDB. The performance and robustness of SPVec were also confirmed on independent test sets obtained from DrugBank database. Also, based on the whole DrugBank dataset, we predicted the possibilities of all unlabeled DTIs, where two of the top five predicted novel DTIs were supported by external evidences. These results indicated that SPVec can provide an effective and efficient way to discover reliable DTIs, which would be beneficial for drug reprofiling.},

Like the Word2vec models, where vectors of closely related words are in close proximity in the vector space, Mol2vec learns vector representations of molecular substructures that point in similar directions for chemically related substructures. Compounds can finally be encoded as vectors by summing the vectors of the individual substructures and, for instance, be fed into supervised machine learning approaches to predict compound properties. The underlying substructure vector embeddings are obtained by training an unsupervised machine learning approach on a so-called corpus of compounds that consists of all available chemical matter. The resulting Mol2vec model is pretrained once, yields dense vector representations, and overcomes drawbacks of common compound feature representations such as sparseness and bit collisions. The prediction capabilities are demonstrated on several compound property and bioactivity data sets and compared with results obtained for Morgan fingerprints as a reference compound representation. Mol2vec can be easily combined with ProtVec, which employs the same Word2vec concept on protein sequences, resulting in a proteochemometric approach that is alignment-independent and thus can also be easily used for proteins with low sequence similarities.},

Read-across is the "new paradigm" which aims to predict toxicity by identifying similar, data rich, source compounds. This assumes that similar molecules tend to exhibit similar activities i.e. molecular similarity is integral to read-across. Various of molecular fingerprints and similarity measures may be used to calculate molecular similarity. This study investigated the value and concordance of the Tanimoto similarity values calculated using six widely used fingerprints within six toxicological datasets. There was considerable variability in the similarity values calculated from the various molecular fingerprints for diverse compounds, although they were reasonably concordant for homologous series acting via a common mechanism. The results suggest generic fingerprint-derived similarities are likely to be optimally predictive for local datasets, i.e. following sub-categorisation. Thus, for read-across, generic fingerprint-derived similarities are likely to be most predictive after chemicals are placed into categories (or groups), then similarity is calculated within those categories, rather than for a whole chemically diverse dataset.},

	abstract = {Hazard identiﬁcation and dose–response assessment for chemicals of concern found in various environmental media are typically based on epidemiological and/or animal toxicity data. However, human health risk assessments are often requested for many compounds found at contaminated sites throughout the US that have limited or no available toxicity information from either humans or animals. To address this issue, recent efforts have focused on expanding the use of structure–activity relationships (SAR) approaches to identify appropriate surrogates and/or predict toxicological phenotype(s) and associated adverse effect levels. A tiered surrogate approach (i.e., decision tree) based on three main types of surrogates (structural, metabolic, and toxicity-like) has been developed. To select the ﬁnal surrogate chemical and its surrogate toxicity value(s), a weight-of-evidence approach based on the proposed decision tree is applied. In addition, a case study with actual toxicity data serves as the evaluation to support our tiered surrogate approach. Future work will include case studies demonstrating the utility of the surrogate approach under different scenarios for data-poor chemicals. In conclusion, our surrogate approach provides a reasonable starting point for identifying potential toxic effects, target organs, and/or modes-ofaction, and for selecting surrogate chemicals from which to derive either reference or risk values.},

In recent years, there have been many eﬀorts focused on the challenges involved in read-across development, its scientiﬁc justiﬁcation and documentation for both chemical hazard and risk assessment purposes. Here, we summarise a selection of the read-across frameworks published in technical guidance documents or in the literature, and review their respective similarities and diﬀerences. There was a great deal of consensus between the diﬀerent frameworks in terms of the general steps outlined and the similarity contexts considered although the terminology, decision context (chemical hazard and/or risk assessment purposes) and scope varied. A harmonised hybrid framework is proposed to help reconcile the common guiding principles and steps of the read-across process which should be helpful in expanding the scope and decision context of the existing frameworks. This harmonised framework is also intended to illustrate where generalised and systematic read-across approaches taking into consideration new approach methodology (NAM) information can be applied.},

	abstract = {Read-across is one of the most frequently used alternative tools for hazard assessment, in particular for complex endpoints such as repeated dose or developmental and reproductive toxicity. Read-across extrapolates the outcome of a specific toxicological in vivo endpoint from tested (source) compounds to “similar” (target) compound(s). If appropriately applied, a read-across approach can be used instead of de novo animal testing. The read-across approach starts with structural/ physicochemical similarity between target and source compounds, assuming that similar structural characteristics lead to similar human hazards. In addition, similarity also has to be shown for the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic properties of the grouped compounds. To date, many read-across cases fail to demonstrate toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic similarities. New concepts, in vitro and in silico tools are needed to better characterise these properties, collectively called new approach methodologies (NAMs). This white paper outlines a general read-across assessment concept using NAMs to support hazard characterization of the grouped compounds by generating data on their dynamic and kinetic properties. Based on the overarching read-across hypothesis, the read-across workflow suggests targeted or untargeted NAM testing also outlining how mechanistic knowledge such as adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) can be utilized. Toxicokinetic models (biokinetic and PBPK), enriched by in vitro parameters such as plasma protein binding and hepatocellular clearance, are proposed to show (dis)similarity of target and source compound toxicokinetics. Furthermore, in vitro to in vivo extrapolation is proposed to predict a human equivalent dose, as potential point of departure for risk assessment. Finally, the generated NAM data are anchored to the existing in vivo data of source compounds to predict the hazard of the target compound in a qualitative and/ or quantitative manner. To build this EU-ToxRisk read-across concept, case studies have been conducted and discussed with the regulatory community. These case studies are briefly outlined.},

	abstract = {At the 2019 annual meeting of the European Environmental Mutagen and Genomics Society a workshop session related to the use of read across concepts in toxicology was held. The goal of this session was to provide the audience an overview of general read-across concepts. From ECHA’s read across assessment framework, the starting point is chemical similarity. There are several approaches and algorithms available for calculating chemical similarity based on molecular descriptors, distance/similarity measures and weighting schemata for speciﬁc endpoints. Therefore, algorithms that adapt themselves to the data (endpoint/s) and provide a good ability to distinguish between structural similar and not similar molecules regarding speciﬁc endpoints are needed and their use discussed. Toxico-dynamic end points are usually in the focus of read across cases. However, without appropriate attention to kinetics and metabolism such cases are unlikely to be successful. To further enhance the quality of read across cases new approach methods can be very useful. Examples based on a biological approach using plasma metabolomics in rats are given. Finally, with the availability of large data sets of structure activity relationships, in silico tools have been developed which provide hitherto undiscovered information. Automated process is now able to assess the chemical – activity space around the molecule target substance and examples are given demonstrating a high predictivity for certain endpoints of toxicity. Thus, this session provides not only current state of the art criteria for good read across, but also indicates how read-across can be further developed in the near future.},

Herein we present a hybrid measure for asymmetric similarity calculations on the basis of maximum common core structures. This similarity function can be effectively applied to compare small reference compounds with larger test molecules, which is difficult using conventional metrics.},

SAR-based "read across" approaches continue to be broadly used to address toxicological data gaps. The potential additional uncertainty introduced into risk assessments as a result of application of read across approaches to fill data gaps has been widely discussed (OECD, 2007; ECETOC, 2012; Patlewicz et al., 2013), but to date a systematic framework to guide the characterization of uncertainty in read across assessments has not been proposed. The current manuscript presents both a systematic framework to describe potential areas of additional uncertainty that may arise in read across (evaluated based on the number and suitability of analogues contributing data, severity of the critical effect, and effects and potency concordance), as well as a questionnaire for evaluating and documenting consideration of these potential additional sources of uncertainty by risk assessors. Application of this framework represents a next step in standardizing the read across process, both by providing a means to transparently assign a level of uncertainty to a SAR-based read across assessment and by facilitating consistency in read across conclusions drawn by different risk assessors.},

	abstract = {Read-across is one of the most frequently used non-animal approaches for filling toxicological data gaps. There is a universal realization that considerations of the metabolic fates of the target substance and proposed source analogue(s) are important in accepting or rejecting a read-across hypothesis. Comparisons of target and source metabolic information most often suffers from the lack of experimental data. These data voids have prompted the development and use of alternative methods. With various limitations, several in silico tools are available to aid an evaluator in appraising metabolic similarity. Metabolic maps, arrays of 2D molecular structures of (a)biotic transformation products, allow for side-by-side visual comparison of stepwise routes of conversion of the target and source chemicals. There are two varieties of metabolic maps – documented and simulated. A document metabolic map is one derived for in vivo or in vitro experimental data. A simulated one is a map derived from metabolic pathway predictions of possible or probable metabolites coupled with expert judgment. Here, through a series of examples, the advantages of using the metabolic information, provided by the OASIS software, are exemplified. This will aid in establishing metabolic consistency between the chemicals used in a read-across argument (i.e., establish similarity in their (a)biotic transformations). Of particular importance are found to be the identification of common metabolic pathway(s), common metabolite(s), and similarity concerning the formation of reactive metabolites.},

The pivotal means of acquiring acceptance of a read-across prediction is identifying and assessing uncertainties associated with it. This study has identified and summarised, in a structured way, the variety of uncertainties that potentially impact acceptance of a read-across argument. The main sources of uncertainty were established and divided into four main categories: i) the regulatory use of the prediction, ii) the data for the apical endpoint being assessed, iii) the read-across argumentation, and iv) the similarity justification. Specifically, the context of, and relevance to, the regulatory use of a read-across will dictate the acceptable level of uncertainties. The apical endpoint (or other) data must be of sufficient quality and relevance for data gap filling. Read-across argumentation uncertainties include: i) mechanistic plausibility (i.e., the knowledge of the chemical and biological mechanisms leading to toxicity), ii) completeness of the supporting evidence, iii) robustness of the supporting data, and iv) Weight-of-Evidence. In addition, similarity arguments for chemistry, physico-chemical properties, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics are linked to these read-across argumentation issues. To further progress in this area, a series of questions are proposed with the goal of addressing each type of uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Category formation, grouping and read across methods are broadly applicable in toxicological assessments and may be used to fill data gaps for chemical safety assessment and regulatory decisions. In order to facilitate a transparent and systematic approach to aid regulatory acceptance, a strategy to evaluate chemical category membership, to support the use of read-across predictions that may be used to fill data gaps for regulatory decisions is proposed. There are two major aspects of any read-across exercise, namely assessing similarity and uncertainty. While there can be an over-arching rationale for grouping organic substances based on molecular structure and chemical properties, these similarities alone are generally not sufficient to justify a read-across prediction. Further scientific justification is normally required to justify the chemical grouping, typically including considerations of bioavailability, metabolism and biological/mechanistic plausibility. Sources of uncertainty include a variety of elements which are typically divided into two main issues: the uncertainty associated firstly with the similarity justification and secondly the completeness of the read-across argument. This article focuses on chronic toxicity, whilst acknowledging the approaches are applicable to all endpoints. Templates, developed from work to prepare for the application of new toxicological data to read-across assessment, are presented. These templates act as proposals to assist in assessing similarity in the context of chemistry, toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics as well as to guide the systematic characterisation of uncertainty both in the context of the similarity rationale, the read across data and overall approach and conclusion. Lastly, a workflow for reporting a read-across prediction is suggested.},

	abstract = {Read-across is an alternative approach exploited to address information requirements for risk assessment and for regulatory programmes such as the European Union's REACH regulation. Whilst read-across approaches are accepted in principle, difficulties still remain in applying them consistently in practice. Recent work within Cefic LRI and ECETOC attempted to summarize the state-of-the-art and identify some of the barriers to broader acceptance of read-across approaches to overcome these. Acceptance is undoubtedly thwarted partly by the lack of a systematic framework to characterize the read-across justification and identify the uncertainties particularly for complex regulatory endpoints such as repeated-dose toxicity or prenatal developmental toxicity. Efforts are underway by the European Chemical's Agency (ECHA) to develop a Read-Across Assessment Framework (RAAF) and private sector experts have also considered the development of a similar framework. At the same time, mechanistic chemical categories are being proposed which are underpinned by Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs). Currently such frameworks are only focusing on discrete organic substances, though the AOP approach could conceivably be applied to evaluate more complex substances such as mixtures. Here we summarize the deliberations of the Cefic LRI read-across team in characterizing scientific confidence in the development and evaluation of read-across.},

	abstract = {Read-across is a data gap filling technique utilized to predict the toxicity of a target chemical using data from similar analogues. Recent efforts such as Generalized Read-Across (GenRA) facilitate automated read-across predictions for untested chemicals. GenRA makes predictions of toxicity outcomes based on "neighboring" chemicals characterized by chemical and bioactivity fingerprints. Here we investigated the impact of biological similarities on neighborhood formation and read-across performance in predicting hazard (based on repeat-dose testing outcomes from US EPA ToxRefDB v2.0). We used targeted transcriptomic data on 93 genes for 1060 chemicals in HepaRG™ cells that measure nuclear receptor activation, xenobiotic metabolism, cellular stress, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Transcriptomic similarity between chemicals was calculated using binary hit-calls from concentration-response data for each gene. We evaluated GenRA performance in predicting ToxRefDB v2.0 hazard outcomes using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the baseline approach (chemical fingerprints) versus transcriptomic fingerprints and a combination of both (hybrid). For all endpoints, there were significant but only modest improvements in ROC AUC scores of 0.01 (2.1\%) and 0.04 (7.3\%) with transcriptomic and hybrid descriptors, respectively. However, for liver-specific toxicity endpoints, ROC AUC scores improved by 10\% and 17\% for transcriptomic and hybrid descriptors, respectively. Our findings suggest that using hybrid descriptors formed by combining chemical and targeted transcriptomic information can improve in vivo toxicity predictions in the right context.},

The expanding number of chemicals found in commerce and the environment, coupled with time and resource requirements for traditional toxicity testing and exposure characterization, continue to underscore the need for new approaches. In 2005, EPA charted a new course to address this challenge by embracing computational toxicology (CompTox) and investing in the technologies and capabilities to push the field forward. The return on this investment has been demonstrated through results and applications across a range of human and environmental health problems, as well as initial application to regulatory decision-making within programs such as the EPA's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program. The CompTox initiative at EPA is more than a decade old. This manuscript presents a blueprint to guide the strategic and operational direction over the next 5 years. The primary goal is to obtain broader acceptance of the CompTox approaches for application to higher tier regulatory decisions, such as chemical assessments. To achieve this goal, the blueprint expands and refines the use of high-throughput and computational modeling approaches to transform the components in chemical risk assessment, while systematically addressing key challenges that have hindered progress. In addition, the blueprint outlines additional investments in cross-cutting efforts to characterize uncertainty and variability, develop software and information technology tools, provide outreach and training, and establish scientific confidence for application to different public health and environmental regulatory decisions.},

Acceptance of read-across remains an ongoing challenge with several efforts underway for identifying and addressing uncertainties. Here we demonstrate an algorithmic, automated approach to evaluate the utility of using in vitro bioactivity data ("bioactivity descriptors", from EPA's ToxCast program) in conjunction with chemical descriptor information to derive local validity domains (specific sets of nearest neighbors) to facilitate read-across for up to ten in vivo repeated dose toxicity study types. Over 3239 different chemical structure descriptors were generated for a set of 1778 chemicals and supplemented with the outcomes from 821 in vitro assays. The read-across prediction of toxicity for 600 chemicals with in vivo data was based on the similarity weighted endpoint outcomes of its nearest neighbors. The approach enabled a performance baseline for read-across predictions of specific study outcomes to be established. Bioactivity descriptors were often found to be more predictive of in vivo toxicity outcomes than chemical descriptors or a combination of both. This generalized read-across (GenRA) forms a first step in systemizing read-across predictions and serves as a useful component of a screening level hazard assessment for new untested chemicals.},

	abstract = {Despite an abundance of online databases providing access to chemical data, there is increasing demand for high-quality, structure-curated, open data to meet the various needs of the environmental sciences and computational toxicology communities. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) web-based CompTox Chemistry Dashboard is addressing these needs by integrating diverse types of relevant domain data through a cheminformatics layer, built upon a database of curated substances linked to chemical structures. These data include physicochemical, environmental fate and transport, exposure, usage, in vivo toxicity, and in vitro bioassay data, surfaced through an integration hub with link-outs to additional EPA data and public domain online resources. Batch searching allows for direct chemical identifier (ID) mapping and downloading of multiple data streams in several different formats. This facilitates fast access to available structure, property, toxicity, and bioassay data for collections of chemicals (hundreds to thousands at a time). Advanced search capabilities are available to support, for example, non-targeted analysis and identification of chemicals using mass spectrometry. The contents of the chemistry database, presently containing {\textasciitilde} 760,000 substances, are available as public domain data for download. The chemistry content underpinning the Dashboard has been aggregated over the past 15 years by both manual and auto-curation techniques within EPA's DSSTox project. DSSTox chemical content is subject to strict quality controls to enforce consistency among chemical substance-structure identifiers, as well as list curation review to ensure accurate linkages of DSSTox substances to chemical lists and associated data. The Dashboard, publicly launched in April 2016, has expanded considerably in content and user traffic over the past year. It is continuously evolving with the growth of DSSTox into high-interest or data-rich domains of interest to EPA, such as chemicals on the Toxic Substances Control Act listing, while providing the user community with a flexible and dynamic web-based platform for integration, processing, visualization and delivery of data and resources. The Dashboard provides support for a broad array of research and regulatory programs across the worldwide community of toxicologists and environmental scientists.},

It has been established that structural consideration alone is inadequate for selecting analogues and justifying their use, and biological relevance must be incorporated. Here we introduce an approach for considering biological and toxicological related features quantitatively to compute a similarity score that is concordant with suitability for a read-across prediction for systemic toxicity. Fingerprint keys for comparing metabolism, reactivity, and physical chemical properties are presented and used to compare these attributes for 14 case study chemicals each with a list of potential analogues. Within each case study, the sum of these nonstructural similarity scores is consistent with suitability for read-across established using an approach based on expert judgment. Machine learning is applied to determine the contributions from each of the similarity attributes revealing their importance for each structure class. This approach is used to quantify and communicate the differences between a target and a potential analogue as well as rank analogue quality when more than one is relevant. A numerical score with easily interpreted fingerprints increases transparency and consistency among experts, facilitates implementation by others, and ultimately increases chances for regulatory acceptance.},

	abstract = {Read-across (RAX) is a popular data-gap filling technique that uses category and analogue approaches to predict toxicological endpoints for a target. Despite its increasing relevance, RAX relies on human expert judgement and lacks a reproducible and automated protocol. It also only relies on structural similarity for identifying the analogues, while other aspects are often neglected. In this paper, we propose an automated procedure for the selection of analogues for data gap-filling. Analogues were identified with a decision algorithm that integrates three similarity metrics, each considering different toxicologically relevant aspects (i.e., structural, biological and metabolic similarity). Structural filters based on the presence of maximum common substructures (MCS) and common functional groups were applied to narrow the chemical space for the analogues search. The procedure has been implemented as a workflow in KNIME and is freely available. The workflow provides informative tabular and graphical outputs to support toxicologists and risk assessors in drawing conclusion based on the RAX approach. The procedure has been validated for its predictive power on two datasets related to high-tier in vivo toxicological endpoints, i.e. human hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The validation results gave good accuracy values (i.e., up to 0.79 for the binary hepatotoxicity classification and up to 0.67 for the three-class DILI classification) that were higher than those returned by RAX based on the sole use of structural similarity. Results confirmed the suitability of the procedure as a source of data to support regulatory decision-making.},

Various methods have been developed for quantifying the similarity between reduced graphs including fingerprint approaches, graph matching, and an edit distance method. The edit distance approach quantifies the degree of similarity of two reduced graphs based on the number and type of operations required to convert one graph to the other. An attractive feature of the edit distance method is the ability to assign different weights to different operations. For example, the mutation of an aromatic ring node to an acyclic node may be assigned a higher weight than the mutation of an aromatic ring to an aliphatic ring node. In this paper, we describe a genetic algorithm (GA) for training the weights of the different edit distance operations. The method is applied to specific activity classes extracted from the MDDR database to derive activity-class specific weights. The GA-derived weights give substantially improved results in recall experiments as compared to using weights assigned on intuition. Furthermore, such activity specific weights may provide useful structure--activity information for subsequent design efforts. In a virtual screening setting when few active compounds are known, it may be more useful to have weights that perform well across a variety of different activity classes. Thus, the GA is also trained on multiple activity classes simultaneously to derive a generalized set of weights. These more generally applicable weights also represent a substantial improvement on previous work.},

There are now many different TIs available, and many of them are discussed in this chapter, with respect largely to their use as descriptors in QSAR/QSPR modeling. Three types in particular stand out, molecular connectivities developed by Randic and Kier and Hall, electrotopological state (E-state) values developed by Kier and Hall, and information content indices developed by Basak and co-workers. New TIs are still appearing, despite some criticism that there are already too many types of TI, that they are difficult of interpretation, and that they are inferior to physicochemical descriptors in modeling.},

Chemotypes are expressed in the XML-based Chemical Subgraphs and Reactions Markup Language (CSRML), and can be encoded not only with connectivity and topology but also with properties of atoms, bonds, electronic systems, or molecules. CSRML has been developed in parallel with a public set of chemotypes, i.e., the ToxPrint chemotypes, which are designed to provide excellent coverage of environmental, regulatory, and commercial-use chemical space, as well as to represent chemical patterns and properties especially relevant to various toxicity concerns. A software application, ChemoTyper has also been developed and made publicly available in order to enable chemotype searching and fingerprinting against a target structure set. The public ChemoTyper houses the ToxPrint chemotype CSRML dictionary, as well as reference implementation so that the query specifications may be adopted by other chemical structure knowledge systems. The full specifications of the XML-based CSRML standard used to express chemotypes are publicly available to facilitate and encourage the exchange of structural knowledge.},

These keysets were originally constructed and optimized for substructure searching. We report on improvements in the performance of MDL keysets which are reoptimized for use in molecular similarity. Classification performance for a test data set of 957 compounds was increased from 0.65 for the 166 bit keyset and 0.67 for the 960 bit keyset to 0.71 for a surprisal S/N pruned keyset containing 208 bits and 0.71 for a genetic algorithm optimized keyset containing 548 bits. We present an overview of the underlying technology supporting the definition of descriptors and the encoding of these descriptors into keysets. This technology allows definition of descriptors as combinations of atom properties, bond properties, and atomic neighborhoods at various topological separations as well as supporting a number of custom descriptors. These descriptors can then be used to set one or more bits in a keyset. We constructed various keysets and optimized their performance in clustering bioactive substances. Performance was measured using methodology developed by Briem and Lessel. “Directed pruning” was carried out by eliminating bits from the keysets on the basis of random selection, values of the surprisal of the bit, or values of the surprisal S/N ratio of the bit. The random pruning experiment highlighted the insensitivity of keyset performance for keyset lengths of more than 1000 bits. Contrary to initial expectations, pruning on the basis of the surprisal values of the various bits resulted in keysets which underperformed those resulting from random pruning. In contrast, pruning on the basis of the surprisal S/N ratio was found to yield keysets which performed better than those resulting from random pruning. We also explored the use of genetic algorithms in the selection of optimal keysets. Once more the performance was only a weak function of keyset size, and the optimizations failed to identify a single globally optimal keyset. Instead multiple, equally optimal keysets could be produced which had relatively low overlap of the descriptors they encoded.},

GenRA attempts to mimic a human expert's manual read-across reasoning for filling data gaps about new chemicals from known chemicals with an interpretable and automated approach based on nearest-neighbors. A key objective of GenRA is to systematically explore different choices of input data selection and neighborhood definition to objectively evaluate predictive performance of automated read-across estimates of chemical properties. RESULTS: We have implemented genra-py as a python package that can be freely used for chemical safety analysis and risk assessment applications. Automated read-across prediction in genra-py conforms to the scikit-learn machine learning library's estimator design pattern, making it easy to use and integrate in computational pipelines. We demonstrate the data-driven application of genra-py to address two key human health risk assessment problems namely: hazard identification and point of departure estimation.

Frameworks and formats have been created to help facilitate read-across development, evaluation, and residual uncertainties. However, read-across remains an expert-driven approach with each assessment decided on its own merits with no objective means of evaluating performance or quantifying uncertainties. Here, the underlying motivation of creating an algorithmic approach to read-across, namely the Generalised Read-Across (GenRA) approach, is described. The overall objectives of the approach were to quantify performance and uncertainty. Progress made in quantifying the impact of each similarity context commonly relied upon as part of read-across assessment are discussed. The framework underpinning the approach, the software tools developed to date and how GenRA can be used to make and interpret predictions as part of a screening level hazard assessment decision context are illustrated. Future directions and some of the overarching issues still needed in this field and the extent to which GenRA might facilitate those needs are discussed.},

	abstract = {Read-across is a popular data gap filling technique within category and analogue approaches for regulatory purposes. Acceptance of read-across remains an ongoing challenge with several efforts underway for identifying and addressing uncertainties. Here we demonstrate an algorithmic, automated approach to evaluate the utility of using in vitro bioactivity data ("bioactivity descriptors", from EPA's ToxCast program) in conjunction with chemical descriptor information to derive local validity domains (specific sets of nearest neighbors) to facilitate read-across for up to ten in vivo repeated dose toxicity study types. Over 3239 different chemical structure descriptors were generated for a set of 1778 chemicals and supplemented with the outcomes from 821 in vitro assays. The read-across prediction of toxicity for 600 chemicals with in vivo data was based on the similarity weighted endpoint outcomes of its nearest neighbors. The approach enabled a performance baseline for read-across predictions of specific study outcomes to be established. Bioactivity descriptors were often found to be more predictive of in vivo toxicity outcomes than chemical descriptors or a combination of both. This generalized read-across (GenRA) forms a first step in systemizing read-across predictions and serves as a useful component of a screening level hazard assessment for new untested chemicals.},

Our algebra in RKHS allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or ﬁxed-point iterations. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that our algorithms are often more than 1000 times faster than existing approaches.},

	abstract = {Read-across is a well-established data-gap filling technique used within analogue or category approaches. Acceptance remains an issue, mainly due to the difficulties of addressing residual uncertainties associated with a read-across prediction and because assessments are expert-driven. Frameworks to develop, assess and document read-across may help reduce variability in read-across results. Data-driven read-across approaches such as Generalised Read-Across (GenRA) include quantification of uncertainties and performance. GenRA also offers opportunities on how New Approach Method (NAM) data can be systematically incorporated to support the read-across hypothesis. Herein, a systematic investigation of differences in expert-driven read-across with data-driven approaches was pursued in terms of building scientific confidence in the use of read-across. A dataset of expert-driven read-across assessments that made use of registration data as disseminated in the public International Uniform Chemical Information Database (IUCLID) (version 6) of Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Study Results were compiled. A dataset of ∼5000 read-across cases pertaining to repeated dose and developmental toxicity was extracted and mapped to content within EPA’s Distributed Structure Searchable Toxicity database (DSSTox) to retrieve chemical name and structural identification information. Content could be mapped to ∼3600 cases which when filtered for unique cases with curated quantitative structure–activity relationship-ready SMILES resulted in 389 target-source analogue pairs. The similarity between target and the source analogues on the basis of different contexts – from structural similarity using chemical fingerprints to metabolic similarity using predicted metabolic information was evaluated. An attempt was also made to quantify the relative contribution each similarity context played relative to the target-source analogue pairs by deriving a model which predicted known analogue pairs. Finally, point of departure values (PODs) were predicted using the GenRA approach underpinned by data extracted from the EPA’s Toxicity Values Database (ToxValDB). The GenRA predicted PODs were compared with those reported within the REACH dossiers themselves. This study offers generalisable insights on how read-across is already applied for regulatory submissions and expectations on the levels of similarity necessary to make decisions.},

	abstract = {A systematic expert-driven process is presented for evaluating analogs for read across in SAR (structure activity relationship) toxicological assessments. The approach involves categorizing potential analogs based upon their degree of structural, reactivity, metabolic and physicochemical similarity to the chemical with missing toxicological data (target chemical). It extends beyond structural similarity, and includes differentiation based upon chemical reactivity and addresses the potential that an analog and target could show toxicologically significant metabolic convergence or divergence. In addition, it identifies differences in physicochemical properties, which could affect bioavailability and consequently biological responses observed in vitro or in vivo. The approach provides a stepwise decision tree for categorizing the suitability of analogs, which qualitatively characterizes the strength of the evidence supporting the hypothesis of similarity and level of uncertainty associated with their use for read across. The result is a comprehensive framework to apply chemical, biochemical and toxicological principles in a systematic manner to identify and evaluate factors that can introduce uncertainty into SAR assessments, while maximizing the appropriate use of all available data.},

Detailed understanding of the MIE provides the ideal data for determining chemical properties required to elicit the MIE. This study utilized high-throughput screening data from the ToxCast program, coupled with chemical structural information, to generate chemical clusters using three similarity methods pertaining to nine MIEs within an AOP network for hepatic steatosis. Three case studies demonstrate the utility of the mechanistic information held by the MIE for integrating biological and chemical data. Evaluation of the chemical clusters activating the glucocorticoid receptor identified activity differences in chemicals within a cluster. Comparison of the estrogen receptor results with previous work showed that bioactivity data and structural alerts can be combined to improve predictions in a customizable way where bioactivity data are limited. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) highlighted that while structural data can be used to offset limited data for new screening efforts, not all ToxCast targets have sufficient data to define robust chemical clusters. In this context, an alternative to additional receptor assays is proposed where assays for proximal key events downstream of AHR activation could be used to enhance confidence in active calls. These case studies illustrate how the AOP framework can support an iterative process whereby in vitro toxicity testing and chemical structure can be combined to improve toxicity predictions. In vitro assays can inform the development of structural alerts linking chemical structure to toxicity. Consequently, structurally related chemical groups can facilitate identification of assays that would be informative for a specific MIE. Together, these activities form a virtuous cycle where the mechanistic basis for the in vitro results and the breadth of the structural alerts continually improve over time to better predict activity of chemicals for which limited toxicity data exist.},

Most mutagenicity prediction models are based on a single experimental type and lack other experimental combination data as support, resulting in limited application scope and predictive ability. In this study, we partitioned data from GENE-TOX, CPDB, and Chemical Carcinogenesis Research Information System according to the weight-of-evidence method for modelling. In our data set, in vivo and in vitro experiments in groups as well as prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell experiments were included in accordance with the ICH guideline. We compared the two experimental combinations mentioned in the weight-of-evidence method and reintegrated the experimental data into three groups. Nine sub-models and three fusion models were established using random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and back propagation (BP) neural network algorithms. When fusing base models under the same algorithm according to the ensemble rules, all models showed excellent predictive performance. The RF, SVM, and BP fusion models reached a prediction accuracy rate of 83.4\%, 80.5\%, 79.0\% respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) reached 0.853, 0.897, 0.865 respectively. Therefore, the established fusion QSAR models can serve as an early warning system for mutagenicity of compounds.},

Whereas the longer history of QSAR led to recognize the crucial requirements for predictivity, there are still challenges faced by adopting Read Across to a larger extent in a regulatory setting, namely standardization and objective criteria. In previous research, suitable conditions for applying Read Across to the prediction of the Ames mutagenicity of metabolites and degradation products of pesticides were established: a standardized similarity criterion based simultaneously on basic molecular properties and Structural Similarity was successfully applied to a number of case studies. Here the investigation is extended to a large database of curated Ames mutagenicity results. For around 2,000 chemicals for which the similarity criterion was applicable, the predictivity of Read Across was high: specificity 0.72, sensitivity 0.90, accuracy 0.85. This compares favourably with the Ames test intra-assay variability, and with the predictivity of QSAR models. The need for standardization and rigorous validation of Read Across is emphasized.},

	abstract = {With the aim of providing faster, more economical, animal-free tools to predict toxicity, quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) approaches are increasingly applied to the chemical risk assessment-in particular genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The more recent period of time has witnessed refinements of the predictive systems, with the collection of larger training sets and continued fine-tuning, together with an increased interest for the use of QSAR by regulatory authorities. This literature review provides an updated snapshot of the present state of the art in the evaluation of QSAR methods as applied to genotoxicity. Overall, the abilities of software tools to predict Ames test mutagenicity were comparable with previously published evaluations, with sensitivity ranging 0.72-0.96, and specificity ranging 0.65-0.86 in applications to public data sets. These values compare quite fairly with the intrinsic variability of the Ames test. A preliminary analysis indicated a consistency with the results of the Japan Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences of Japan (DGM/NIHS) Ames/QSAR international collaborative project. Applications to a variety of external test sets pointed to the need of further improvements of the coverage/representation of the whole chemical space. Combinations of tools showed that sensitivity is usually increased at the expense of a decrease in specificity, whereas the supervision by expert judgement generated more equilibrated results. This points to the existence of a large area of context-dependent expert knowledge, which has not been formalised yet and has the potential to substantially improve the prediction systems. The overall evidence suggests that (Q)SARs for the Ames test have sufficient reliability for use in prioritisation processes as well as to support regulatory decisions in combination with other evidence. The use of highly sensitive genotoxicity QSARs in tiered integrations with other tools is suggested as a mean to shortlist chemicals for which no further testing is necessary.},

The previously published consolidated EURL ECVAM Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity Database, which includes substances that elicited a positive response in the Ames test, constitutes a collection of data that serves as a reference for a number of regulatory activities in the area of genotoxicity testing. Consequently, we considered it important to expand the database to include substances that fail to elicit a positive response in the Ames test, i.e., Ames negative substances. Here, we describe a curated collection of 211 Ames negative substances, with a summary of complementary data available for other genotoxicity endpoints in vitro and in vivo, plus available carcinogenicity data. A descriptive analysis of the data is presented. This includes a representation of the chemical space formed by the Ames-negative database with respect to other substances (e.g. REACH registered substances, approved drugs, pesticides, etc.) and a description of the organic functional groups found in the database.

This is the first international guideline that addresses the use of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models in lieu of actual toxicological studies for human health assessment. Therefore, QSAR models for Ames mutagenicity now require higher predictive power for identifying mutagenic chemicals. To increase the predictive power of QSAR models, larger experimental datasets from reliable sources are required. The Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences (DGM/NIHS) of Japan recently established a unique proprietary Ames mutagenicity database containing 12140 new chemicals that have not been previously used for developing QSAR models. The DGM/NIHS provided this Ames database to QSAR vendors to validate and improve their QSAR tools. The Ames/QSAR International Challenge Project was initiated in 2014 with 12 QSAR vendors testing 17 QSAR tools against these compounds in three phases. We now present the final results. All tools were considerably improved by participation in this project. Most tools achieved {\textgreater}50\% sensitivity (positive prediction among all Ames positives) and predictive power (accuracy) was as high as 80\%, almost equivalent to the inter-laboratory reproducibility of Ames tests. To further increase the predictive power of QSAR tools, accumulation of additional Ames test data is required as well as re-evaluation of some previous Ames test results. Indeed, some Ames-positive or Ames-negative chemicals may have previously been incorrectly classified because of methodological weakness, resulting in false-positive or false-negative predictions by QSAR tools. These incorrect data hamper prediction and are a source of noise in the development of QSAR models. It is thus essential to establish a large benchmark database consisting only of well-validated Ames test results to build more accurate QSAR models.},

One critical aspect of analogue evaluation is the extent to which target and source analogues are metabolically similar. In this study, a set of 37 structurally diverse chemicals were compiled from the EPA ToxCast inventory to compare and contrast a selection of metabolism in silico tools, in terms of their coverage and performance relative to metabolism information reported in the literature. The aim was to build understanding of the scope and capabilities of these tools and how they could be utilised in a read-across assessment. The tools were Systematic Generation of Metabolites (SyGMa), Meteor Nexus, BioTransformer, Tissue Metabolism Simulator (TIMES), OECD Toolbox, and Chemical Transformation Simulator (CTS). Performance was characterised by sensitivity and precision determined by comparing predictions against literature reported metabolites (from 44 publications). A coverage score was derived to provide a relative quantitative comparison between the tools. Meteor, TIMES, Toolbox, and CTS predictions were run in batch mode, using default settings. SyGMa and BioTransformer were run with user-defined settings, (two passes of phase I and one pass of phase II). Hierarchical clustering revealed high similarity between TIMES and Toolbox. SyGMa had the highest coverage, matching an average of 38.63\% of predictions generated by the other tools though was prone to significant overprediction. It generated 5,125 metabolites, which represented 54.67\% of all predictions. Precision and sensitivity values ranged from 1.1-29\% and 14.7-28.3\% respectively. The Toolbox had the highest performance overall. A case study was presented for 3,4-Toluenediamine (3,4-TDA), assessed for the derivation of screening-level Provisional Peer Reviewed Toxicity Values (PPRTVs), was used to demonstrate the practical role in silico metabolism information can play in analogue evaluation as part of a read-across approach.},

	abstract = {Read-across is a useful data gap filling technique used within category and analogue approaches in regulatory hazard and risk assessment. Recently we developed an algorithmic, approach called Generalised Read-Across (GenRA) () which makes read-across predictions of toxicity effects using a similarity weighted average of source analogues characterised by their chemical and/or bioactivity descriptors. A default GenRA approach (termed baseline GenRA) relies on identifying 10 source analogues relative to a target substance that are structurally similar based on Morgan chemical fingerprints and computing an activity score to estimate presence or absence of in vivo toxicity. This current study investigated the impact that similarity in bioavailability plays in altering the local neighbourhood of source analogues as well as read-across performance relative to baseline GenRA using physicochemical property information as a surrogate for bioavailability. Two approaches were evaluated: 1) a filtering approach which restricted structurally related analogues based on their physicochemical properties; and 2) a search expansion approach which included additional analogues based on a combined structural and physicochemical similarity index. Filtering minimally improved performance, and was very dependent on the similarity threshold selected. The search expansion approach performed at least as well as the baseline GenRA, and showed up to a 9\% improvement in read-across performance for at least 10 of the 50 organs considered. We summarise the overall impact that physicochemical information plays on GenRA performance, illustrate the improvement for a specific case study substance and describe how to select the most appropriate physicochemical similarity threshold to achieve optimal read-across performance depending on the toxicity effect and chemical of interest. The analyses show that physicochemical property information does result in a modest (up to 9\% increase) improvement in structural based read-across predictions.},

The need to investigate a system, not only as individual components but as a whole, emerges. This can be done by examining the elementary constituents individually and then how these are connected. The myriad components of a system and their interactions are best characterized as networks and they are mainly represented as graphs where thousands of nodes are connected with thousands of vertices. In this article we demonstrate approaches, models and methods from the graph theory universe and we discuss ways in which they can be used to reveal hidden properties and features of a network. This network profiling combined with knowledge extraction will help us to better understand the biological significance of the system.},

graphs. Graph algorithms are currently used in isomer generation, coding of 
chemical compounds and reactions, chemical database search, similarity and 
diversity assessment. An important graph theory application is the numerical 
characterization of chemical structures with graph invariants, that can be 
polynomials, spectra, atomic or molecular topological indices. After a brief 
presentation of graph theory and chemical graphs, the molecular graphs are 
defined. The most important molecular graph matrices, polynomials, and spectra 
are introduced, and some examples are presented. A large variety of mathematical 
operations are applied to molecular graphs giving atomic and molecular structural 
descriptors; the most important topological indices are reviewed, and their 
applications in structure-property models are briefly presented.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124604},
	abstract = {Accurate in silico predictions of chemical substance ecotoxicity has become an important issue in recent years. Most conventional methods, such as the Ecological Structure-Activity Relationship (ECOSAR) model, cluster chemical substances empirically based on structural information and then predict toxicity by employing a log P linear regression model. Due to empirical classification, the prediction accuracy does not improve even if new ecotoxicity test data are added. In addition, most of the conventional methods are not appropriate for predicting the ecotoxicity on inorganic and/or ionized compounds. Furthermore, a user faces difficulty in handling multiple Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) formulas with one chemical substance. To overcome the flaws of the conventional methods, in this study a new method was developed that applied unsupervised machine learning and graph theory to predict acute ecotoxicity. The proposed machine learning technique is based on the large AIST-MeRAM ecotoxicity test dataset, a software program developed by the National Institute of Advanced Industry Science and Technology for Multi-purpose Ecological Risk Assessment and Management, and the Molecular ACCess System (MACCS) keys that vectorize a chemical structure to 166-bit binary information. The acute toxicity of fish, daphnids, and algae can be predicted with good accuracy, without requiring log P and linear regression models in existing methods. Results from the new method were cross-validated and compared with ECOSAR predictions and show that the new method provides better accuracy for a wider range of chemical substances, including inorganic and ionized compounds.},

compounds with their structures employing the interdisciplinary knowledge of chemistry, mathematics, biology as well as physics. Several studies have attempted to mathematically correlate the chemistry and property (physicochemical/ biological/toxicological) of molecules using various computationally
or experimentally derived quantitative parameters termed as descriptors. The dimensionality of the descriptors depends on the type of algorithm employed and defines the nature of QSAR analysis. The most interesting feature of predictive QSAR models is that the behavior of any new or even hypothesized
molecule can be predicted by the use of the mathematical equations. The phrase “2D-QSAR” signifies development of QSAR models using 2D-descriptors. Such predictor variables are the most widely practised ones because of their simple and direct mathematical algorithmic nature involving
no time consuming energy computations and having reproducible operability. 2D-descriptors have a deluge of contributions in extracting chemical attributes and they are also capable of representing the 3D molecular features to some extent; although in no case they should be considered as the
ultimate one, since they often suffer from the problems of intercorrelation, insufficient chemical information as well as lack of interpretation. However, by following rational approaches, novel 2D-descriptors may be developed to obviate various existing problems giving potential 2D-QSAR equations,
thereby solving the innumerable chemical mysteries still unexplored.},

Subsequently, biological activity was predicted for each analogue involved in the data set using these models, which was then compared with the reported glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta inhibitory activities.

To solve the program we use "replicator" equations, a class of simple continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in various branches of theoretical biology.

In this paper we present a matching algorithm based on a ﬁxpoint computation that is usable across different scenarios. The algorithm takes two graphs (schemas, catalogs, or other data structures) as input, and produces as output a mapping between corresponding nodes of the graphs. Depending on the matching goal, a subset of the mapping is chosen using ﬁlters. After our algorithm runs, we expect a human to check and if necessary adjust the results. As a matter of fact, we evaluate the ‘accuracy’ of the algorithm by counting the number of needed adjustments. We conducted a user study, in which our accuracy metric was used to estimate the labor savings that the users could obtain by utilizing our algorithm to obtain an initial matching. Finally, we illustrate how our matching algorithm is deployed as one of several high-level operators in an implemented testbed for managing information models and mappings.},

We propose a complementary approach, applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we compute a measure that says "two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects:" This general similarity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, SimRank can be combined with other domain-specific similarity measures. We suggest techniques for efficient computation of SimRank scores, and provide experimental results on two application domains showing the computational feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

In this study, a major effort was undertaken to compile a large genotoxicity dataset (54,805 records for 9299 substances) from several public sources (e.g., TOXNET, COSMOS, eChemPortal). The names and outcomes of the different assays were harmonized, and assays were annotated by type: gene mutation in Salmonella bacteria (Ames assay) and chromosome mutation (clastogenicity) in vitro or in vivo (chromosome aberration, micronucleus, and mouse lymphoma Tk +/- assays). This dataset was then evaluated to assess genotoxic potential using a categorization scheme, whereby a substance was considered genotoxic if it was positive in at least one Ames or clastogen study. The categorization dataset comprised 8442 chemicals, of which 2728 chemicals were genotoxic, 5585 were not and 129 were inconclusive. QSAR models (TEST and VEGA) and the OECD Toolbox structural alerts/profilers (e.g., OASIS DNA alerts for Ames and chromosomal aberrations) were used to make in silico predictions of genotoxicity potential. The performance of the individual QSAR tools and structural alerts resulted in balanced accuracies of 57-73\%. A Naïve Bayes consensus model was developed using combinations of QSAR models and structural alert predictions. The 'best' consensus model selected had a balanced accuracy of 81.2\%, a sensitivity of 87.24\% and a specificity of 75.20\%. This in silico scheme offers promise as a first step in ranking thousands of substances as part of a prioritization approach for genotoxicity.},

In an extensive experimental evaluation, we study the classification accuracy of a large suite of graph kernels on established benchmarks as well as new datasets. We compare the performance of popular kernels with several baseline methods and study the effect of applying a Gaussian RBF kernel to the metric induced by a graph kernel. In doing so, we find that simple baselines become competitive after this transformation on some datasets. Moreover, we study the extent to which existing graph kernels agree in their predictions (and prediction errors) and obtain a data-driven categorization of kernels as result.

	abstract = {Data mining algorithms are facing the challenge to deal with an increasing number of complex objects. For graph data, a whole toolbox of data mining algorithms becomes available by defining a kernel function on instances of graphs. Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths. These kernels are computable in polynomial time, retain expressivity and are still positive definite. In experiments on classification of graph models of proteins, our shortest-path kernels show significantly higher classification accuracy than walk-based kernels.},

Article 25 clearly states that: “[i]n order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort.” In practice, however, the standard information requirements under REACH are still primarily filled using animal studies. This paper presents examples illustrating that animal testing is not always undertaken only as a last resort. Six over-arching issues have been identified which contribute to this: (1) non-acceptance of existing animal or non-animal data, (2) non-acceptance of read-across, (3) inflexible administrative processes, (4) redundancy of testing, (5) testing despite animal welfare concerns and (6) testing for cosmetic-only ingredients. We, members of the Animal-Free Safety Assessment (AFSA) Collaboration, who work together to accelerate the global adoption of non-animal approaches for chemical safety assessment, herein propose several recommendations intended to aid the European Commission, the European Chemicals Agency and registrants to protect human health and the environment while avoiding unnecessary animal tests - truly upholding the last resort requirement in REACH.},

Key to our method is a rapid feature extraction scheme based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism on graphs.

A family of kernels can be deﬁned based on this Weisfeiler-Lehman sequence of graphs, including a highly efﬁcient kernel comparing subtree-like patterns. Its runtime scales only linearly in the number of edges of the graphs and the length of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph sequence. In our experimental evaluation, our kernels outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several graph classiﬁcation benchmark data sets in terms of accuracy and runtime. Our kernels open the door to large-scale applications of graph kernels in various disciplines such as computational biology and social network analysis.},

A leading design paradigm for this is the convolution kernel, which decomposes structured objects into their parts and sums over all pairs of parts. Assignment kernels, in contrast, are obtained from an optimal bijection between parts, which can provide a more valid notion of similarity. In general however, optimal assignments yield indeﬁnite functions, which complicates their use in kernel methods. We characterize a class of base kernels used to compare parts that guarantees positive semideﬁnite optimal assignment kernels. These base kernels give rise to hierarchies from which the optimal assignment kernels are computed in linear time by histogram intersection. We apply these results by developing the Weisfeiler-Lehman optimal assignment kernel for graphs. It provides high classiﬁcation accuracy on widely-used benchmark data sets improving over the original Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel.},

Effective graph analytics provides users a deeper understanding of what is behind the data, and thus can benefit a lot of useful applications such as node classification, node recommendation, link prediction, etc. However, most graph analytics methods suffer the high computation and space cost. Graph embedding is an effective yet efficient way to solve the graph analytics problem. It converts the graph data into a low dimensional space in which the graph structural information and graph properties are maximally preserved. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review of the literature in graph embedding. We first introduce the formal definition of graph embedding as well as the related concepts. After that, we propose two taxonomies of graph embedding which correspond to what challenges exist in different graph embedding problem settings and how the existing work address these challenges in their solutions. Finally, we summarize the applications that graph embedding enables and suggest four promising future research directions in terms of computation efficiency, problem settings, techniques and application scenarios.},

	abstract = {Graph analytics can lead to better quantitative understanding and control of complex networks, but traditional methods suffer from high computational cost and excessive memory requirements associated with the high-dimensionality and heterogeneous characteristics of industrial size networks. Graph embedding techniques can be effective in converting high-dimensional sparse graphs into low-dimensional, dense and continuous vector spaces, preserving maximally the graph structure properties. Another type of emerging graph embedding employs Gaussian distribution-based graph embedding with important uncertainty estimation. The main goal of graph embedding methods is to pack every node's properties into a vector with a smaller dimension, hence, node similarity in the original complex irregular spaces can be easily quantified in the embedded vector spaces using standard metrics. The generated nonlinear and highly informative graph embeddings in the latent space can be conveniently used to address different downstream graph analytics tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction, community detection, visualization, etc.). In this Review, we present some fundamental concepts in graph analytics and graph embedding methods, focusing in particular on random walk-based and neural network-based methods. We also discuss the emerging deep learning-based dynamic graph embedding methods. We highlight the distinct advantages of graph embedding methods in four diverse applications, and present implementation details and references to open-source software as well as available databases in the Appendix for the interested readers to start their exploration into graph analytics.},

These latent representations encode social relations in a continuous vector space, which is easily exploited by statistical models. DeepWalk generalizes recent advancements in language modeling and unsupervised feature learning (or deep learning) from sequences of words to graphs. DeepWalk uses local information obtained from truncated random walks to learn latent representations by treating walks as the equivalent of sentences. We demonstrate DeepWalk's latent representations on several multi-label network classification tasks for social networks such as BlogCatalog, Flickr, and YouTube. Our results show that DeepWalk outperforms challenging baselines which are allowed a global view of the network, especially in the presence of missing information. DeepWalk's representations can provide \$F\_1\$ scores up to 10\% higher than competing methods when labeled data is sparse. In some experiments, DeepWalk's representations are able to outperform all baseline methods while using 60\% less training data. DeepWalk is also scalable. It is an online learning algorithm which builds useful incremental results, and is trivially parallelizable. These qualities make it suitable for a broad class of real world applications such as network classification, and anomaly detection.},

In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods, random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some potential applications and future directions.

However, many graph analytics tasks such as graph classification and clustering require representing entire graphs as fixed length feature vectors. While the aforementioned approaches are naturally unequipped to learn such representations, graph kernels remain as the most effective way of obtaining them. However, these graph kernels use handcrafted features (e.g., shortest paths, graphlets, etc.) and hence are hampered by problems such as poor generalization. To address this limitation, in this work, we propose a neural embedding framework named graph2vec to learn data-driven distributed representations of arbitrary sized graphs. graph2vec's embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner and are task agnostic. Hence, they could be used for any downstream task such as graph classification, clustering and even seeding supervised representation learning approaches. Our experiments on several benchmark and large real-world datasets show that graph2vec achieves significant improvements in classification and clustering accuracies over substructure representation learning approaches and are competitive with state-of-the-art graph kernels.},

In this work, we present a new deep learning algorithm named as graph convolutional network with graph attention network (GCNAT) to predict the potential associations of disease-related metabolites. First, we construct a heterogeneous network based on known metabolite-disease associations, metabolite-metabolite similarities and disease-disease similarities. Metabolite and disease features are encoded and learned through the graph convolutional neural network. Then, a graph attention layer is used to combine the embeddings of multiple convolutional layers, and the corresponding attention coefficients are calculated to assign different weights to the embeddings of each layer. Further, the prediction result is obtained by decoding and scoring the final synthetic embeddings. Finally, GCNAT achieves a reliable area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95 and the precision-recall curve of 0.405, which are better than the results of existing five state-of-the-art predictive methods in 5-fold cross-validation, and the case studies show that the metabolite-disease correlations predicted by our method can be successfully demonstrated by relevant experiments. We hope that GCNAT could be a useful biomedical research tool for predicting potential metabolite-disease associations in the future.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN), a deep learning model able to predict structured sequences of data. Precisely, GCRN is a generalization of classical recurrent neural networks (RNN) to data structured by an arbitrary graph. The structured sequences can represent series of frames in videos, spatio-temporal measurements on a network of sensors, or random walks on a vocabulary graph for natural language modeling. The proposed model combines convolutional neural networks (CNN) on graphs to identify spatial structures and RNN to find dynamic patterns. We study two possible architectures of GCRN, and apply the models to two practical problems: predicting moving MNIST data, and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset. Experiments show that exploiting simultaneously graph spatial and dynamic information about data can improve both precision and learning speed.},

	abstract = {The maximum common property similarity (MCPhd) method is presented using descriptors as a new approach to determine the similarity between two chemical compounds or molecular graphs. This method uses the concept of maximum common property arising from the concept of maximum common substructure and is based on the electrotopographic state index for atoms. A new algorithm to quantify the similarity values of chemical structures based on the presented maximum common property concept is also developed in this paper. To verify the validity of this approach, the similarity of a sample of compounds with antimalarial activity is calculated and compared with the results obtained by four different similarity methods: the small molecule subgraph detector (SMSD), molecular fingerprint based (OBabel\_FP2), ISIDA descriptors and shape-feature similarity (SHAFTS). The results obtained by the MCPhd method differ significantly from those obtained by the compared methods, improving the quantification of the similarity. A major advantage of the proposed method is that it helps to understand the analogy or proximity between physicochemical properties of the molecular fragments or subgraphs compared with the biological response or biological activity. In this new approach, more than one property can be potentially used. The method can be considered a hybrid procedure because it combines descriptor and the fragment approaches.},

Twenty-three topological indices were calculated for a data set of 667 different chemicals in an effort to further underline their chemical meaning. Several analyses using chemometric methods were performed on this data set. A refined model, obtained by using principal components analysis, was achieved with only ten relevant topological descriptors. The representation of the data set, in terms of the first six principal components, was used to determine a flexible measure of similarity for chemicals; this representation is then used to deal with different chemical problems and to allow chemical interpretations of topological index behaviour.},
